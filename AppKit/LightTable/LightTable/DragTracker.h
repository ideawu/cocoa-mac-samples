  Abstract:
  The Drag Tracker tracks the changes of the mouse during a primary button drag. Tracking starts when the left mouse button is held down and the movement of the cursor exceeds a threshold value. Tracking ends when the mouse button is released. The owning view must route mouseDown:, mouseDragged: and mouseUp: responder messages to this tracker.
