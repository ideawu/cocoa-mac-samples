  Abstract:
  The Dual Touch Tracker tracks the changes of two touches on a multi-touch trackpad. Tracking starts when the movement of two concurrent touches exceeds a threshold value. Tracking ends when either a third touch begins, or one of the touches are released, or touches are cancelled. The owning view must route touchesBeganWithEvent:, touchesMovedWithEvent:, touchesEndedWithEvent: and touchesCancelledWithEvent: responder messages to this tracker.
