 Abstract:
 The Click Tracker informs the view of single and double clicks. A single click is defined as a mouse down with a clickCount less than or equal to 1. A double click is a mouse up with a clickCount equal to 2. Tip: A view can easily change its behavior in response to a click by changing the action property. The owning view must route mouseDown: and mouseUp: responder messages to this tracker.
