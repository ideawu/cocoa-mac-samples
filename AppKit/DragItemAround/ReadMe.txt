DragItemAround Code Samples
===========================

This directory contains two variations of the DragItemAround example that is discussed in the Creating a Custom View chapter of the View Programming Guide for Cocoa. Below is a list of the folders and what each contains:

1-DragItemAround

This version of the project supports the basic functionality described in the Creating a Custom View chapter of the View Programming Guide for Cocoa.

2-DragItemAround_ShortCircuit

This version of the project provides an alternate implementation of the mouse-down handling in the view. It “short circuits” the event loop handling the mouse-down/mouse-dragged/mouse-up events in a single mouseDown: implementation. 

You may incorporate sample code from these examples into your applications without restriction, although the sample code has been provided "as is" and the responsibility for its operation is completely yours. However, you should not redistribute the source as "Apple Sample Code" if you make changes to it. If you're going to re-distribute the source, we require that you make it clear in the source that, although the code derived from Apple Sample Code,  you've since made changes to it.
